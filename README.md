# Zoom Join Bot
This is a python bot to join zoom call.

Input must be made manually, later I will add integration with calender and csv.

It cannot open if the user is in fullscreen.

Path is set in appdata roaming. If user installed somewhere else, user must change the path.

User can input more than one schedule using the GUI.
